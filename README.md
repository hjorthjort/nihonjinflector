# Nihonjinflector (日本ジンフレクトル)

Inflection practice tools for Japanese verbs.

Because of the incredible regularity of Japanese verbs, inflections can be
created with no knowledge of a verbs meaning. This tool takes advantage of that
fact, and can be used as a flashcard system. When a verb is added, all its
inflections can be practiced.
